# 1-Article-Mock-up-Practice
This is a mock-up of an article provided by an image. Goal: Reverse engineer the image to turn into an HTML page.
This project was very straight-forward. An article in PDF format was provided and it was my job to duplicate it in an HTML file. 
I used the snipping tool to demonstrate the before (pictured left) and after (pictured right) results.
